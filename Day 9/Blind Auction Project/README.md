Day 9 - Blind Auction Project

This project focuses on applying Python fundamentals in a practical scenario by creating a blind auction program. It covers:

- Taking user input with input()

- Using dictionaries to store data ({name: bid})

- Controlling program flow with loops and conditionals

- Finding the maximum value in a dictionary

- Defining and using functions

- Basic console output formatting

What I Learned

- How to collect multiple user inputs dynamically

- How to store and manipulate data in dictionaries

- How to use loops to repeat actions until a condition is met

- How to find the highest bid using iteration or the max() function

- How to organize code with functions for clarity and reusability
