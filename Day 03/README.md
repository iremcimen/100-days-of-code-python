# Day 3 - Conditional Statements in Python

Topics:
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Nested conditions

## What I Learned
- Writing multi-branch logic
- Handling different user input conditions
- Building a simple "Treasure Island" game with conditional logic

## File
- `task3.py` and `task4.py`: Contains all decision-making practice tasks.
