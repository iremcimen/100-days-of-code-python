# Prime Number Checker Project

This project covers basic Python concepts such as:

* Function definitions with parameters and return values
* Conditional statements (`if`, `for`, `return`)
* User input and output
* Basic loop for primality testing

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

* How to define a function that checks for prime numbers
* How to return Boolean values (`True` or `False`) from a function
* How to take user input and use it as a function argument
* Basic control flow with loops and conditions

## üìÅ File

* `exercise.py`: Contains the `is_prime` function and user interaction code.
